Intro
-----

Hello, my name is Stanislav! I am a software engineer who has specialized in
spacecraft avionics software in the space industry for the past few years. Prior
to that, I worked as a web and mobile application developer.

I am fascinated by topics such as computer redundancy, spacecraft buses, time
synchronization, failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR), as well as
safety-critical software systems and systems engineering. I believe that solving
problems related to these topics is crucial to making spaceflight more
accessible, affordable, and safe, and I am dedicated to contributing to these
technological developments.

What is in this blog?
---------------------

This blog features updates about my spare-time activities as an open-source
software developer. Since my day job is separate from my open-source and
blogging activities, I mostly write about topics related to software
development, such as how-tos, tool notes, testing, and other miscellaneous
things.

StrictDoc project
-----------------

Some time ago, when I was deciding which topics to work on in my spare time for
open-source projects, I chose to focus on Requirements Engineering. My latest
open-source project is called StrictDoc
`<https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc>`_, which aims to create a free
and open-source tool for writing, analyzing, and exchanging requirements. While
I have limited time to devote to this project, with enough dedication and
continuous attention, I believe I can make significant progress. I'm happy to
see that people, including myself, are already using it, which inspires me to
keep developing it further.
