    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <div class="section" id="intro">
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Stanislav! I am a software engineer who specializes in
spacecraft avionics software in the space industry for the past few years. Prior
to that, I worked as a web and mobile application developer.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by topics such as computer redundancy, spacecraft buses, time
synchronization, failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR), as well as
safety-critical software systems and systems engineering. I believe that solving
problems related to these topics is crucial to making spaceflight more
accessible, affordable, and safe, and I am dedicated to contributing to these
technological developments.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-in-this-blog">
<h2 id="what-is-in-this-blog">What is in this blog?</h2>
<p>This blog features updates from my spare-time activities as an open-source
software developer. My daily work is pretty well separated from my open source
and blogging activities, so in this blog, I mostly write about general software
development-related topics like how-to guides, tool notes, testing and other
miscellaneous things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strictdoc-project">
<h2 id="strictdoc-project">StrictDoc project</h2>
<p>Some time ago, when I was deciding which topics to work on in my spare time,
I chose to focus on Requirements Engineering. My most recent
open-source project is called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc">StrictDoc</a>. The goal of the StrictDoc
project is to create a free and open-source tool for writing, analyzing, and
exchanging requirements. Although I have limited time to devote to this project,
I am confident that with enough dedication and continuous attention, I can make
significant progress. It makes me happy to see that people, including myself,
are already using it, which inspires me to keep developing it further.</p>
